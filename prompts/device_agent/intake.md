Device support scope
- This system supports a wide range of remote monitoring devices across many vendors.
- Devices fall into common classes:
  - Blood pressure cuffs
  - Weight scales
  - Pulse oximeters
  - ECG or cardiac monitors
  - Implanted device transmitters
  - Tablets or gateway hubs

Support approach
- Troubleshoot based on device class and common failure modes.
- Use universal steps (power, connectivity, pairing, workflow).
- Do not assume brand-specific instructions.
- Escalate to the device support team when the issue cannot be confidently resolved.
